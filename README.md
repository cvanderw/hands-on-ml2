# hands-on-ml2

This workspace includes code and notebooks related to the [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow book (2nd edition)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).

The authoritative workspace for this material can be found at https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2. I have referred to the solutions in that workspace in the course of solving the problems in the book.
